  Eat in measure and defy the doctor.
  Eat weel’s drink weel’s brither.
  Eating and drinking wants but a beginning.

  Either win the horse or tine the saddle.
  Either the tod or the fearn bush.
  E’ening red and morning grey, is a taiken of a bonny day.
  E’ening oats are gude morning fodder.
  E’en as ye win’t say ye may wear’t.
  Embro’ justice, the greater the crime the sma’er the fine.

  Fine feathers mak fine birds.—Fools’ haste is nae speed.
  Fire and water are gude servants, but ill masters.
  Flaes and a girning wife are waukrife bed-fellows.
  Fleying a bird is no the way to grip it.
  Flitting of farms mak mailings dear.—Friends ’gree best sindry.
  Fools shou’d nae hae chapping stieks.
  Fools ravel and wise men redd.—Fumblers are ay fond o’ weans.
  Fools and bairns shou’d nae see a ha’f done turn.
  Fools mak feasts, and wise fouk eat them; the wise mak jests, and fools
    repeat them.
  For fashion’s sake, as dogs gang to the market.
  Fore-warn’d, ha’f armed.—Foul water slockens fire.
  Fresh fish and poor friends grow soon ill-far’d.
  Friends are like fiddle-strings, they mauna be screw’d owre tight.
  Frost and fausehood hae baith a dirty waygang.

  Giff-Gaff makes gude friends.—Gie you an inch ye’ll tak an ell.
  Gie a dog an ill name and he’ll soon be hang’d.
  Gie the deil his due.—Glasses and lasses are bruckle ware.
  God help great fowk, the poor can beg.
  God ne’er sent the mouth but he sent meat wi’t.
  God send you mair wit and mair siller.
  Great barkers are nae biters.—Greening wives are ay greedy.
  Gie a beggar a bed and he’ll pay you wi’ lice.


H

  Haud a hank in your ain hand.—Hae gars a deaf man hear.
  Hair and hair makes the earl’s head bare.—Hale-sale’s gude sale.
  Hame is hame if it were ne’er sae hamely.
  Hang them that hae nae shift, and them that hae owre mony.
  Hang a thief when he’s young, and he’ll no steal when he’s auld.
  Hanging’s nae better than it’s ea’d.—Hardships sinle come single.
  He begs frae them that borrow’d frae him.
  He brings a staff to break his ain head.
  He does na ay ride when he saddles his horse.
  He fells twa dogs wi’ ae stane.—He had his finger in the pye.

  He has gotten a bite o’ his ain bridle.
  He has nae as muckle sense as a cow can haud in her faulded nieve.

  He’ll soon be a beggar that cannot say nay.
  He loo’d mutton weel that licked where the ewe lay.
  He’ll no sell his hen on a rainy day.
  He may weel swim that has his head hadden up.
  He never lies but when the holly’s green.
  He needs maun rin that the deil drives.
  He’s wise that kens whan he’s weel, and can haud himsel sae.
  He’s scant o’ news that tells his father was hanged.
  He’s an Aberdeen’s man, he taks his word again.
  He’s a wise bairn that kens his ain father.
  He’s uneo fou in his ain house that canna pike a bane in his neibour’s.
  He’s a proud horse that winna bear his ain provender.
  He’s like a singet cat, better than he’s likely.
  He’s a worthless gudeman that’s no miss’d.
  He stumbles at a strae and loups o’er a won-lyne.
  He speaks like a prent-book.—He that comes unca’d sits unserv’d.
  He that aught the cow gangs nearest her tail.

  He that’s ill to himsel will be gude to naebody.
  He that laughs at his ain joke spills the sport o’t.
  He that speers a’, only gets wit o’ part.
  He wad skin a loose for the tallow.
  He that sleeps wi’ dogs maun rise wi’ flaes.
  He’s no sae daft as he’s daft like.—His egg has ay twa youks.
  He that winna when he may, he shanna when he wad.
  He that woos a widow should woo her day and night.
  He that wad eat the kirnel maun crack the nut.
  He that will to Coupar will to Coupar.

  He wats na whilk end o’ him’s uppermost.
  He wad gar you trow that the moon’s made o’ green cheese.
  He wad tine his lugs if they werna tacked to him.
  His bark is war than his bite.—Hooly and fairly gangs far in a day.
  Hungry dogs are blythe o’ bursten puddings.


I

  I canna sell the cow and sup her milk.—I hae ither tow on my rock.
  I can see as far into a mill-stane as he that pick’d it.
  I hae a gude bow, but its in the castle.
  I had rather gae by your door than o’er your grave.
  I hae got an ill kame for my ain head.
  I hae mair ado than a dish to wash.
  I hae baith my meat and my mense.
  I hae seen mair than I hae eaten, or ye wadna be there.

  I wadna mak fish o’ ane and flesh o’ anither.
  I wish you readier meat than a rinning hare.

  It’s a poor house whare thers’s neither a bairn nor a mouse.
  It’s a shame to eat the cow and worry on the tail.
  It’s a sorry hen that canna scrape for ae bird.
  It’s a sair dung bairn that mayna greet.—It’s gude to be sib to siller.
  It’s a’ tint that’s done to auld fo’k and bairns.
  It’s but kindly that the pock sa’r of the herring.
  It’s better to sup wi’ a cutty than want a spoon.
  It’s dear coft honey that’s lick’d aff a thorn.
  It’s eith crying Yule on anither man’s stool.
  It’s fair in ha’ where beards wag a’.—It’s gude sleeping in a hale skin.
  It’s gude maut that comes o’ will.—It’s gude to be side but no trailing.
  It’s gude gear that pleases the merchant.
  It’s gude to be gude in your time, ye kenna how lang it may last.

    tail.
  It’s ill bringing butt what’s no there ben.
  It’s kittle shooting at corbies and clergy.

  It’s lang or ye need to cry, shou, to an egg.
  It’s lang or like-to-die fill the kirk-yard.
  It’s muckle gars the tailor laugh, for suitors girn ay.
  It’s needless to pour water on a drown’d mouse.
  It’s no the cowl that maks the friar.—It maun be true that a’ fo’k says.
  It’s nae sin to tak a gude price, but in gi’ing ill measure.
  It’s nae play when ane laughs and anither greets.
  It’s no what is she? but what was she?
  It’s nae laughing to girn in a widdy.—It’s weel war’d wasters want.
  It’s o’er far between the kitchen and the ha’.
  It’s o’er late to spare when the bottom’s bare.
  It’s past joking when the head’s aff.
  It’s weel that our fau’ts are no written on our face.
  It’s time enough to skreigh when ye’re strucken.
  It’s time enough to mak my bed when I’m gaun to lie down.
  It’s lang or four bare legs gather heat in the bed.
  It may come in an hour that winna come in seven year.
  It will be a feather out o’ your wing.
  It sets a sow weel to wear a saddle.
  It sets you weel to gab again wi’ your bannet on.

  Kail hains bread.—Kame sindle came sair.—Kamesters are ay creeshy.
  Keep woo and it will be dirt, keep lint and it will be silk.

  Keep your kill-dry’d taunts to your mouldy-hair’d maidens.
  Keep your breath to cool your crowdie.
  Keep your mouth close and your een open.
  Kindness comes a-will, it canna be coft.
  Kindness will creep whare it canna gang.
  Kindle a candle at baith ends it will soon be done.
  King’s cauff’s worth other fo’ks corn.—Kissing gans by favour.
  King’s cheese gaes hauf awa in pairings.
  Kiss a carl and clap a carl, and that’s the way to tine a carl.
  Kythe in your ain colours that fo’k may ken you.

  Ladies and turkies need delicate upbringing.
  Laith to bed and laith to rise.—Lang straes are nae motes.

  Lang tongu’d wives gae lang wi’ bairn.
  Langest at fire soonest finds cauld.
  Lang speaking part maun spill.—Love me love my dog.

  Like the maidens o’ Bayordine ye learn by the ear.
  Like hens, ye rin ay to the tap o’ the heap.
  Like the bairns o’ Falkirk, ye mind naething but mischief.
  Like frien’less dogs mair sleep than meat.
  Like the cat, fain fish wad ye eat, but ye are laith to weet your feet.
  Like the wife wi’ the mony daughters, the best comes hindmost.
  Lippen to me but look to yoursel’.
  Little Jock gets the little dish, and that hauds him lang little.
  Little said is soon mended, little gear’s soon spended.
  Little wit i’ the head maks muckle travel to the feet.
  Little may an auld nag do that maunna nicher.
  Live upon love as lavrocks do on leeks.
  Loud on the loan was ne’er a gude milk cow.
  Love and light winna hide.—Love me lightly love me lang.
  Love’s as warm among cotters as courtiers.
  Love o’er het soonest cools.

  Ower muckle o’ aething is gude for naething.
  Ower mony grieves but hinders the wark.
  O’ twa ills choose the least.—Out o’ debt out o’ danger.
  Out o’ the peat-pot into the gutter.

  There’s naething ill said that’s nae ill tane.
  There’s nae place like hame, as the deil said when he fan’ himsel in the
    Court o’ Session.
  There was ne’er a silly Jocky but there was as silly a Jenny.

  They are ay gude that are far awa.—True blue will ne’er stain.
  They are like the grices, if you kittle their wame they fa’ on their
    backs.
  They hae need o’ a canny cook that hae but ae egg to their dinner.
  They ne’er saw great dainties that think a haggis a feast.
  They shou’d kiss the gude-wife that wad win the gude-man.
  They that see you a’ day winna break the house for you at night.
  They that get a word o’ soon rising may lie a’ day.
  They that laugh in the morning may greet ere night.
  They that drink langest live langest.
  They that hae routh o’ butter may lay it thick on their scone.
  They that lie down for love shou’d rise for hunger.
  They were scant o’ bairns that brought you up.
  They were never fain that fidg’d, nor fa’ that licked dishes.
  They ne’er ga’e wi’ the speet but they get wi’ the ladle.
  Three can keep a secret if twa be awa.
  Time and tide will tarry for nae man.
  Touch a gawd horse on the back and he’ll fling.
  Tramp on a snail and she’ll shoot out her horns.
  Twa blacks will ne’er mak a white.
  Twine two, your minny was a gude spinner.


U

  Up hill spare me, down hill tak tent to thee.
  Use makes perfectness.


W

  Wanton kittens mak douce cats.—When drink’s in wit’s out.
  Wae’s the wife that want’s the tongue, but weel’s the man that gets her.
  Weans maun creep ere they gang.—Women’s wark’s ne’er done.
  Wedding and ill wintering tame baith man and beast.
  Weel kens the mouse when the cat’s out o’ the house.
  Welcom’s the best dish in the kitchen.
  We’ll ne’er ken the worth o’ the water till the well gae dry.
  We’re ay to learn as lang’s we live.—We canna baith sup and blaw.
  We’ll bark oursels ere we buy dogs sae dear.
  We may ken your eild by the runkles o’ your horn.
  We may ken your meaning by your mumping.
  What’s gotten owre the deil’s back will gang awa under his belly.
  When ae door stecks anither opens.—Wilfu’ waste maks waefu’ want.
  When friends meet hearts warm.—Woo sellers ken ay woo buyers.
  When the tod preaches tak tent o’ the lambs.
  When the wame’s fou, the banes wad be at rest.
  When petticoats woo, brecks come speed.
  When you’re serv’d a’ the geese are water’d.
  While the pow’s shaving the lice maun flit.
  When ye’re gaun and coming the gate’s no toom.
  Where the dyke’s laighest it is eithiest to loup.
  Where there’s owre muckle courtesy, there’s little kindness.
  Winter thunder bodes simmer hunger.
  Work for nought maks fo’k dead sweer.


Y

  Ye’re as lang o’ tuning your pipes as ane wad play a spring.
  Ye cam a day after the fair.—Ye hae gotten a ravel’d hesp o’t.
  Ye cut lang whangs out o’ ither fo’k’s leather.
  Ye canna preach out o’ your ain pupit.—Ye hae a crap for a’ corn.
  Ye canna get leave to thrive for thrang.
  Ye drive the plough before the owsen.
  Ye hae gien the wolfe the wedder to keep.
  Ye hae sitten your time, as mony a gude hen has done.
  Ye hae o’er foul feet to come sae far ben.
  Ye hae tint your ain stomach and fund a tike’s.
  Ye hae the wrang sow by the lug.—Ye ken wha drinkers dree.
  Ye kenna wha may cool your ain kail yet.
  Yelping curs may rise mastiffs.—Ye’re mair fley’d than hurt.
  Ye may get waur bodes or Beltane.
  Ye may dight your neb and flee up.
  Ye mete my pease by your ain peck.
  Ye ne’er saw green cheese but your een reel’d.
  Ye ride sae near the rumple ye’ll let nane loup on behind you.
  Ye’re like a miller’s dog, you lick your lips ere the pock be opened.
  Ye’re sae keen o’ the clocking you’ll die in the nest.
  Ye’re nae chicken for a’ your cheeping.
  Ye’re come o’ blude, and sae’s a pudding.
  Ye’re like hens, ye rin ay to the heap.
  Ye shape shoon by your ain shachel’d feet.
  Ye watna what wife’s ladle may cogue your kail.
  Your bread’s baken, you may hing by your girdle.
